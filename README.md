Deathrun-Manager
================

Custom version of deathrun manager by bobbobagan, which is an updated version of xPaw's deathrun manager for 1.6. Edited for zonix deathrun server.

It requires csgocolors in the include folder to be compiled correctly, this is here just so i can have it saved on a good place and to maybe help people.
